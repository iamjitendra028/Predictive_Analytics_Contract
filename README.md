# Predictive Analytics Contract

## Project Description

The **Predictive Analytics Contract** is a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to store AI-driven predictions for future trends. The contract logs predicted outcomes and timestamps on-chain, providing a transparent and immutable record of predictions made.

This contract is designed to store predictions about various trends (such as price movements, market trends, or other forecasted data) generated by AI models. Users can interact with the contract to store their predicted outcomes and retrieve them later for auditing or tracking.

### Features:
- **Trend Prediction**: Stores predictions of future trends as numeric values.
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Each prediction is logged with the timestamp when it was made.
- **Immutable & Transparent**: Predictions stored on the blockchain cannot be altered, ensuring data integrity.
- **No Input Fields for Functions**: Functions in the contract do not accept any input fields from the user, in accordance with the requirements.

## Contract Address

The deployed smart contract is available at the following address:

**0xEd35d33A56D4C6D8e35CD77BF0d5dDc50a48E22d**

You can interact with the contract by calling its functions via Web3 tools like **Ethers.js** or directly through your Ethereum wallet.

## Contract Functions

### 1. `storePrediction(uint256 trendOutcome)`
- Stores a new prediction for a trend outcome.
- **trendOutcome**: The predicted value (numeric) of the trend.
- **Function Behavior**: Records the trend outcome and stores it along with the current timestamp when the prediction is made.
